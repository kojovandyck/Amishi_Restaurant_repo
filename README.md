# Amishi_Restaurant_repo
 This is an attempt to create a POS service for my on-campus restaurant Amishi Mishi. This project uses Appscript, hmtl,css, and js to create an interface that allows the user to make a food purchase using an interactive interface and the vendor to have access to daily purchases, current orders, and inventory of stock.  I got exposure to both back end and front end development as part of the process. All credits and huge thanks to Michael Tottrup and Jess Chan for the amazing inspiration and guidance to new developers. I plan developing the back end, hosting this as a web app via VS and Django, improving interactivity on the web app.
